PFXR is a tool to generate sound FX mainly for games.

It's largely inspired by [BFXR](https://www.bfxr.net/)

* The core implementation made with [PureData](https://puredata.info/), you can find runnable pd patch in **pd/pfxr.pd** folder.
* A libGDX implementation using the PureData patches, you can download and install it from [Releases section](https://github.com/mgsx-dev/pfxr/releases)
